# Polymer: the Ethereum interoperability hub

Polymer is Ethereum's interoperability hub, connecting Ethereum's Layer 2's using the [Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol](https://ibcprotocol.dev).

Welcome to the developer hub for Polymer! We're excited to collaborate with you on building the future of interoperability together.

<!-- Depending on what leads the reader here, we could add Polymer features. But there's a chance that info is duplicated on the developer hub homepage, i.e. polymerlabs.org/developers -->

## Get started

Here's a quick overview of our documentation, depending on what your goals are:

:::note I want to ...

- [**Start testing Polymer's features with quickstart tutorials**](./category/tutorials/)

    Go to [`Tutorials`](./category/tutorials/) to quickly experience a cross-chain dApp leveraging Polymer with ready-made demo applications.

- [**Evaluate why to build cross-chain using Polymer**](./category/why-polymer/)

    Go to [`Why Polymer`](./category/why-polymer/) to understand the context around the interoperability space, why it's an important issue to tackle and why the current landscape leaves a hole for Polymer to fill.

- [**Learn the foundations of Polymer, IBC and virtual IBC**](./category/learn/)

    Go to [`Concepts`](./category/learn/) to dive deep into the concepts making up the Polymer protocol. IBC, virtual IBC as well as the stack to build the Polymer L2 are reviewed.

- [**Learn how to build dApps that are compatible with Polymer**](./category/build/)

    Go to [`Build`](./category/build) to find out how to build IBC-enabled Solidity smart contracts and how to find the vIBC core contracts deployed by Polymer that relayers listen to.

<!-- - [**Run infrastructure**](./category/run-infrastructure/)

    Go to [`Run infrastructure`](./category/run-infrastructure/) to find runbooks on how to run (parts of) the infrastructure required, either in testnet or mainnet environments (when applicable). -->
