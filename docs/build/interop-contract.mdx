# Why Devs Choose Polymer

With Polymer, we enable the smart contracts you already use to be crosschain—a simpler, more flexible way to build multi-chain applications that puts developers first.


<Admonition type="tip">
With Polymer, developers can now treat interoperability as a byproduct of execution within their application contracts— not a separate architecture to manage.

    ## Outdated Messaging

    ![Traditional messaging approach diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c5ea318-be74-4c9d-8f76-392b3097e20a)

    This approach involves:

    - Deploying source and destination contracts for every chain pair.
    - Integrating bridge-specific logic and OApp/gateway contracts.
    - Encoding application logic into payloads executed by the bridge.
    - Managing on-chain fee estimation using external oracles.
    - Parsing and executing data as dictated by the bridge protocol.

    ### Drawbacks

    - **High engineering cost** — weeks or even months to implement and debug.
    - **Single-source-to-single-destination limitation** — additional chains require more messages and more gas.
    - **Infra overhead** — fees estimations by bridges often exceed 10x of execution costs.
        - LZ typical fee: ~$0.30
        - HL typical fee: ~$1.0
    - **Manual reconfiguration** — adding new chains requires bridge updates on all existing instances.

    ## Natively Interoperable Apps (Phat Apps)

    ![Polymer approach diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e41d66-1cb3-46b1-a0b6-accd32b3a7eb)

    - **No contract interfaces needed** — emit standard application events.
        - Polymer supports **state-level proofs**, which allows proving any emitted event without requiring special contracts on the origin chain.
    - **Single proof call** — execute your destination logic using `validateEvent` with proof from Prove API.
        - Polymer e2e latency is close to rollup block times i.e 2-4secs.
    - **App defined API** — events retain their original format defined by the app developers.
        - Proof validation is hyper efficient with on-chain gas costs of under a cent.
    - **Custom logic control** — execute your app-specific validations before processing.

    ### Benefits of interoperable contracts 

    - **Developer simplicity** — build faster, focus on core app logic.
    - **Broadcast model** — emit once, prove anywhere.
    - **No cross-chain boilerplate** — no need to re-configure contracts for every new chain.
    - **Scalability** — as long as your contracts are deterministic, they are future-ready.
    - **Permissionless Execution** — Anyone can submit a valid proof to trigger execution.
        - For enterprise security, additional access control layers can be implemented.

## Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="prove-actions" label="✅ Prove Actions">
    ### Prove Actions Across Chains

    - **Intent Settlement:** Prove that a user fill occurred (e.g., trade executed) before repaying solvers on the origin chain  (e.g., Eco, Catalyst).
    - **Solver-Based Zaps:** Execute user-defined logic (like swaps or vault entry) fronted by solvers and proven via user-signed calldata (more fun with ERC-7702 and AI agents).
    - **Decentralized Governance:** Enable token holders to vote on any chain and prove outcomes back to Ethereum for canonical result aggregation.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="synced-state" label="🔁 Synced State">
    ### Synced Contract State

    - **Lending Protocols:** Synchronize key yield-impacting events across chains to maintain consistent APY (e.g., RiftLend).
    - **Yield Aggregators:** Consolidate yield across multiple chains into a single APY representation  (e.g., Superform) or expand from a single chain to others.
    - **Treasury Sync:** Use for stablecoins or structured products to relay yield/treasury info to all chains without infrastructure duplication.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="build-once" label="🌍 Build Once">
    ### Build Once, Ship Everywhere

    - **Oracle Feeds:** Serve data from a central chain and allow anyone to fetch and prove values on demand in seconds and control your own bottomline—without high messaging fees.
    - **Optimistic Oracles:** Replace bridge-dependent deployments with single-chain proofs—e.g., proving UMA predictions across 100 chains without extra dev work.
    - **Stablecoin Extensions:** Sync yield or treasury status without replicating backends across rollups.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="advanced" label="🧑🏻‍💻 Advanced">
    ### Advanced Use Cases

    - **Batched Intent Settlement:** Prove multiple user intents in one go, drastically reducing settlement overhead for solvers.
    - **Multi-Source Solving:** Aggregate funds from multiple chains to fulfill a single user operation and pay solver back on all chains with a single proof. (e.g., Resource-lock management in OneBalance)
    - **Stringed Transactions:** Execute chain-dependent workflows (swap on A → swap on B → fallback to A if slippage fails) with proof-verified checkpoints. (e.g., Composability stack by Biconomy)
    - **Modular Execution:** Offload compute-heavy matching or auctions to optimized chains (e.g., gather orders on Base, match on Solana, settle back on Base).  (e.g., Everclear)
