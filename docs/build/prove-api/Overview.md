# Overview

## Prove API

The Prove API takes inspiration from Superchain's native interop to define an identifier. This version of the API is designed to prove an entire transaction receipt, with capabilities to prove individual logs or multiple logs within the receipt.

### Current Capabilities:
- **Prove an Entire Receipt:** You can prove an entire transaction receipt from a source blockchain.
- **Prove Logs within Receipt:** As an application, you can prove a single log or multiple logs within the provided receipt.

### User Flow
Before an on-chain message can be sent, the "solver" must first query the Prove API.
1. **Request Proof:** Use the `receipt_requestProof` method to request a proof, which returns a `jobID`.
2. **Poll for Proof:** Use the `receipt_queryProof` method with the `jobID` to poll for proof responses.

The functions can be accessed with POST requests to API end point: proof.sepolia.polymer.zone 

You can even submit requests and experience the API here: https://dashboard.sepolia.polymer.zone/request-proof 

And track your request from the our explorer: ​​https://dashboard.sepolia.polymer.zone/
