# Upcoming Release - Polymer API v1.0

We're excited to announce major enhancements to Polymer's proving infrastructure that deliver **sub-second proof latencies** and introduce **automated transaction execution** capabilities.

## 🔧 API Method Updates & Versioning

### New v1 API Endpoints

We've introduced proper API versioning with improved method naming and enhanced functionality:

**Base URL:** `https://api.polymer.zone/v1/`

| **Legacy (v0)** | **New (v1)** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `polymer_requestProof` | `prove_request` | Request proof generation |
| `polymer_queryProof` | `prove_query` | Query proof status |
| *New* | `execute_request` | Automated execution |
| *New* | `execute_query` | Query execution status |

### Enhanced Response Format

v1 responses now include the original `proofRequest` object for better traceability and debugging, making integration more developer-friendly.

**Migration Note:** Legacy v0 endpoints remain fully supported during the transition period.

## ⚡ Dramatic Latency Improvements

We've completely overhauled our backend infrastructure and optimized interactions with the Polymer chain:

- **Enhanced API Backend:** Streamlined interactions between API Backend and Polymer chain.
- **Upgraded Cosmos SDK:** Latest SDK version enables significantly faster block times

### Performance Gains

| **Metric** | **Previous** | **New** | **Improvement** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Block Time** | 2 seconds | 100ms | **20x faster** |
| **Proof Generation** | 4-5 seconds | **< 1 second** | **5x faster** |
| **API Response** | Variable | Consistent sub-second | **Predictable performance** |

**Result:** Proof requests that previously took 4-5 seconds now complete in **under 1 second**.

## 🎯 Execute API (Beta Release)

Based on strong developer demand for simplified and automated transaction submission, we're beta-releasing our **Execute API** that combines proof generation with automated on-chain execution.

### Key Capabilities

- **Ultra-Fast Submission:** Transactions land on destination chains in **under 300ms**
- **Universal Compatibility:** Any EVM chain, any contract (non-EVM support coming soon)
- **Integrated Workflow:** Proof generation + execution in a single API call
- **End-to-End Speed:** Complete cross-chain execution in **1-1.5 seconds**

### Workflow Comparison

```jsx
// Traditional Approach: ~10+ seconds
1. Request proof (4-5s)
2. Poll for completion
3. Manual transaction submission (5-10s)

// New Execute API: ~1.5 seconds
1. execute_request (includes proof + transaction)
2. execute_query (poll until complete)

```

### Why This Matters

This represents a **massive leap forward** compared to traditional cross-chain systems:

- **Traditional bridges:** ~2 minutes
- **Existing solutions:** 30+ seconds
- **Polymer Execute API:** **1-1.5 seconds end-to-end**

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### For Existing Users

Continue using v0 endpoints - no immediate changes required, you’ll see all the benefits of proof latency. We recommend migrating to v1 for enhanced features like execute API.

### For New Integrations

Start with v1 endpoints for the best experience:

```jsx
// Proof-only workflow
const response = await fetch('https://api.polymer.zone/v1/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    method: "prove_request",
    params: [{ srcChainId: 10, srcBlockNumber: 123456, globalLogIndex: 0 }]
  })
});

// Proof + Execute workflow (Beta)
const executeResponse = await fetch('https://api.polymer.zone/v1/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    method: "execute_request",
    params: [executeEnvelope] // Proof + execution parameters
  })
});
```
