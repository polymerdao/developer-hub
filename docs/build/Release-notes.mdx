# Polymer API v2.0

We're introducing **Prove API v2** with a new proof generation system and standardized proof type naming.

## 🔧 New v2 API Endpoint

**Base URL:** `https://api.polymer.zone/v2/`

The v2 endpoint uses our next-generation proof generation system with improved performance and reliability.

| **Endpoint** | **v1 Proof Type** | **v2 Proof Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EVM proof requests | `evm_v1` | `evm_v2` |
| Solana proof requests | `svm_v1` | `svm_v2` |

### Standardized Proof Type Naming

We've standardized proof type identifiers across all API versions:

| **Legacy Name** | **New Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `log` | `evm_v1` | EVM event proofs (v1 generation) |
| `global_log` | `evm_v1` | EVM event proofs (v1 generation) |
| `solana` | `svm_v1` | Solana event proofs (v1 generation) |
| *New* | `evm_v2` | EVM event proofs (v2 generation) |
| *New* | `svm_v2` | Solana event proofs (v2 generation) |

### Enhanced Response Format

v2 responses include a `proofType` field indicating which proof generation version was used:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "jobID": 12345,
  "proofType": "evm_v2",
  "proof": "0x...",
  "proofRequest": { ... },
  "createdAt": 1708300800,
  "updatedAt": 1708300801
}
```

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### V2 Proofs Require V2 Contracts

V2 proofs (`evm_v2`, `svm_v2`) are **only compatible with the new V2 prover contracts**. They will not work with V1 contracts. If you are using V1 contracts, continue using the `/v1/` endpoint which generates V1 proofs.

| **Proof Type** | **Compatible Contracts** |
| --- | --- |
| `evm_v1`, `svm_v1` | V1 Prover Contracts |
| `evm_v2`, `svm_v2` | V2 Prover Contracts only |

### Removed: Receipt Index / Log Index Request Format

Support for the legacy request format using `receiptIndex` and `logIndex` has been removed. All EVM proof requests must now use `globalLogIndex`:

```jsx
// ❌ No longer supported
{
  "srcChainId": 10,
  "srcBlockNumber": 123456,
  "receiptIndex": 0,
  "logIndex": 2
}

// ✅ Use globalLogIndex instead
{
  "srcChainId": 10,
  "srcBlockNumber": 123456,
  "globalLogIndex": 5
}
```

The `globalLogIndex` is the absolute index of the log within the entire block, not relative to a specific transaction receipt.

## 🛠️ Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

- **v0/v1 endpoints continue to work unchanged** - no migration required
- v0/v1 requests automatically use `evm_v1` or `svm_v1` proof types
- Legacy proof type names (`log`, `global_log`, `solana`) are mapped to new names internally
- If you were using `receiptIndex`/`logIndex`, you must migrate to `globalLogIndex`

### For New Integrations

Use the v2 endpoint to take advantage of the latest proof generation:

```jsx
const response = await fetch('https://api.polymer.zone/v2/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    method: "prove_request",
    params: [{ srcChainId: 10, srcBlockNumber: 123456, globalLogIndex: 0 }]
  })
});
```

# Polymer API v1.0

We're excited to announce major enhancements to Polymer's proving infrastructure that deliver **sub-second proof latencies** and introduce **automated transaction execution** capabilities.

## 🔧 API Method Updates & Versioning

### New v1 API Endpoints

We've introduced proper API versioning with improved method naming and enhanced functionality:

**Base URL:** `https://api.polymer.zone/v1/`

| **Legacy (v0)** | **New (v1)** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `polymer_requestProof` | `prove_request` | Request proof generation |
| `polymer_queryProof` | `prove_query` | Query proof status |
| *New* | `execute_request` | Automated execution |
| *New* | `execute_query` | Query execution status |

### Enhanced Response Format

v1 responses now include the original `proofRequest` object for better traceability and debugging, making integration more developer-friendly.

**Migration Note:** Legacy v0 endpoints remain fully supported during the transition period.

## ⚡ Dramatic Latency Improvements

We've completely overhauled our backend infrastructure and optimized interactions with the Polymer chain:

- **Enhanced API Backend:** Streamlined interactions between API Backend and Polymer chain.
- **Upgraded Cosmos SDK:** Latest SDK version enables significantly faster block times

### Performance Gains

| **Metric** | **Previous** | **New** | **Improvement** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Block Time** | 2 seconds | 100ms | **20x faster** |
| **Proof Generation** | 4-5 seconds | **< 1 second** | **5x faster** |
| **API Response** | Variable | Consistent sub-second | **Predictable performance** |

**Result:** Proof requests that previously took 4-5 seconds now complete in **under 1 second**.

## 🎯 Execute API (Beta Release)

Based on strong developer demand for simplified and automated transaction submission, we're beta-releasing our **Execute API** that combines proof generation with automated on-chain execution.

### Key Capabilities

- **Ultra-Fast Submission:** Transactions land on destination chains in **under 300ms**
- **Universal Compatibility:** Any EVM chain, any contract (non-EVM support coming soon)
- **Integrated Workflow:** Proof generation + execution in a single API call
- **End-to-End Speed:** Complete cross-chain execution in **1-1.5 seconds**

### Workflow Comparison

```jsx
// Traditional Approach: ~10+ seconds
1. Request proof (4-5s)
2. Poll for completion
3. Manual transaction submission (5-10s)

// New Execute API: ~1.5 seconds
1. execute_request (includes proof + transaction)
2. execute_query (poll until complete)

```

### Why This Matters

This represents a **massive leap forward** compared to traditional cross-chain systems:

- **Traditional bridges:** ~2 minutes
- **Existing solutions:** 30+ seconds
- **Polymer Execute API:** **1-1.5 seconds end-to-end**

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### For Existing Users

Continue using v0 endpoints - no immediate changes required, you’ll see all the benefits of proof latency. We recommend migrating to v1 for enhanced features like execute API.

### For New Integrations

Start with v1 endpoints for the best experience:

```jsx
// Proof-only workflow
const response = await fetch('https://api.polymer.zone/v1/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    method: "prove_request",
    params: [{ srcChainId: 10, srcBlockNumber: 123456, globalLogIndex: 0 }]
  })
});

// Proof + Execute workflow (Beta)
const executeResponse = await fetch('https://api.polymer.zone/v1/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    method: "execute_request",
    params: [executeEnvelope] // Proof + execution parameters
  })
});
```
