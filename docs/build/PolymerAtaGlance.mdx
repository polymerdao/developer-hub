# Polymer at a Glance

### App-Side Process

The application workflow follows these key steps:

- **Event Emission**: App emits custom event from their own contract (not Polymer's source-side contract)
- **Proof Request**: App requests proof from backend using Prove API (RPC-like call)
- **Proof Submission**: App relayer submits proof to destination chain contract (pre-configured with Polymer prover)
- **Validation**: Single method call validates proof and returns complete event data as defined by app developer

**Flow Summary**: App emits → Request proof → Submit to validator contract → Get validated event data

### Prove API (Off-chain)

- **Request Proof**: Use `polymer_requestProof` method → returns jobID
- **Poll for Result**: Use `polymer_queryProof` with jobID to get proof
- **Scope**: Designed to prove individual logs/events


### CrossL2ProverV2 Contract (On-chain)

- Validates Polymer rollup state roots
- Verifies log authenticity using proofs
- Allows proof inspection via static calls

#### Important Limitations
- **Current Testing**: Proofs available for last 3-4 hours only
- **Reason**: Cost increases significantly for deeper rollup trie data retrieval
