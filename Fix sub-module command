nclude the vIBC core smart contracts to your project by running the following command into your project:

git add submodule https://github.com/open-ibc/vibc-core-smart-contracts.git [optional-destination-path]
git submodule add https://github.com/open-ibc/vibc-core-smart-contracts.git [optional-destination-path]

You can then import for example the IbcReceiver interface to extend your IBC enabled contract, like so:
@@ -66,4 +66,4 @@ contract MyIbcContract is IbcReceiver {
